PTP Daemon Version 2 Build and Installation Instructions

20 March 2015

George V. Neville-Neil, Wojciech Owczarek

The PTP Daemon is known to work on FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X and Linux systems.

*) Requirements

You will need the following tools and libraries to build ptpd2

1. GNU autotools (automake, autoconf, libtool etc.)
2. PCAP libraries
3. SNMP libraries (optional)

*) Building 

1. cd into the root of the tree (which is where the file you're
   reading resides)

2.  autoreconf -vi

3. ./configure

   To make use of all advanced functions it is recommended to
   configure the build with the following options:

   ./configure --enable-statistics

   To add support for printing all message counters on a SIGUSR2,
   add --enable-sigusr2=counters to the configure parameters.

   To build a slave-only version (with GM logic disabled), build with:

    ./configure --enable-slave-only

    This will build a version incapable of running as master.

    As of 2.3.1, the default timer implamentation used for periodic
    actions uses POSIX timers if only the OS supports it. To disable
    POSIX timer support and use the old interval timer implementation,
    the following switch can be used:

    ./configure --disable-posix-timers

    As of 2.3.1, support was added for multiple unicast destinations
    (both GMs and slaves) - with negotiation (signaling) and without.
    The default maximum number of unicast destinations (also the
    maximum number of slaves for a signaling GM) is set to 16. This
    can be changed to a maximum of 512 using:

   ./configure --with-max-unicast-destinations=[16...512]

4. make

5. Read the manual pages. ptpd2 itself also provides an extensive help:
   run ptpd2 --help to see the short help
   run ptpd2 --long-help to see the long help for all settings
   run ptpd2 -e [key:setting] to display help for a single setting

6. Update test/client-e2e-socket.conf so that its
   "ptpengine:interface = " setting points to a network interface on
   your test machine that can see PTP packets from a grandmaster.

6. Test it in place: ./src/ptpd2 -c test/client-e2e-socket.conf

7. Check the log output of the daemon in /var/run/ptpd2.event.log
   Check statistics output of the daemon in /var/run/ptpd2.stats.log
   Check the status file /var/run/ptpd2.status.log

8. If the results look good, make install

The daemon may work on other Posix based systems but this is not
guaranteed.  Patches and fixes are welcome on the source forge page
